# MEA MVP Open Day 2015
There we go! Another year has past and it's time to write that annual "MVP MEA Open Day" blog post to keep a historical record of what an amazing week-end it was.

This year it's [the second time](http://daron.yondem.com/software/post/MEA_MVP_Open_Day_2014) we are having our regional MVP Open Day and this was just another reminder on itself why we should keep doing this! It was soo much fun to meet with friends and geek out. Honestly It just refreshes my enthusiasm about everything related to Microsoft. Long story short :) if you would like to get a feel of how the week-end was for me take a look at the [photos we took during the event](http://1drv.ms/1G6yBjn  ).

I would like to repeat my thanks to our regional MVP Lead, Hande Kayadeniz and everyone involved making is happen! Keep it up! Love it!
